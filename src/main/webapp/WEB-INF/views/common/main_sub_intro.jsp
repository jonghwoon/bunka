		is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

		<h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
		It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
		<br><br>
		
		<h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
		Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

		<h3>개요</h3> 
		 이미 알고 계시겠지만, 한국은 2003 년 이래 현재까지 OECD 34개국 중 자살로 인한 사망률 1위를 지속하고 있습니다. 
		
		업데이트는 좋은 것이지만 모든 업데이트가 버전 간의 호환을 지원하지는 않듯이, 우리는 가장 빠른 변화의 시대를 살지만, 세대 간의 소통까지 해결할 수는 없었습니다.
		이 호환 불가로 인해 가정은 분해되고 사람은 점점 고립되어갑니다. 
		
		오타쿠는 자살 따윈 하지 않는다 는 이야기가 있습니다. 왜냐하면 다음주에 나올 신작 애니메이션을 봐야 하기 때문입니다. 
		
		저희 팀원들은 재미있게도 각기 다른 취미 하나씩을 가지고 있습니다. 미술, 보컬, 축구, 만화, 캠핑 등… 우리는 그것이 꽤 건강한 습관이라고 생각합니다. 
		
		저희의 팀 프로젝트는, 개인이 소속하고 나누며 유대 할 수 있는 지속 가능한 공동체 결성과 
		독서와 공연 관람 등, 취미 생활을 지원하고 공유할 수 있는 일종의 문화 관리 에코 힐링 시스템입니다.
		
		비록, 결과물이 이 깊은 뜻을 모두 담지는 못했습니다만. 이런 걸 만들어 보고는 싶었습니다.
